# ring-fitting2
Library for background subtraction and kymograph fitting for fluorescence microscopy of vertically immobilized bacteria 

batchAnalyseRing.m : USE THIS to run everything. Analyses one or more ring movies to background subtract and plot kymogrpaphs. See documentation in the file.   

ringAnalysis_example.m: Example script showing how to use this fitting library.

doBgSubAndKymo.m: Background subtract and plot kymogrpaphs for a single ring movie. See documentation in the file.

fitRing.m: Fit a single ring image to a blurred ring + background model. See documentation in the file.              

testing\ :  Various ring movie files and test scripts.

INSTALLATION: Add the 'ring-fitting2' directory to your MATLAB path, and save the updated path  so that it will remain installed next time you start MATLAB.
