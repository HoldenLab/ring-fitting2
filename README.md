# ring-fitting2
INFORMATION 

Software for background subtraction and kymograph fitting for fluorescence microscopy image stacks of vertically immobilized bacteria using VerCINI (Vertical Cell Imaging by Nanostructured Immobilization). First published in Whitley et al, Nature Communications 2021. 
This software is provided as is and without warranty.

OVERVIEW

Performs circular kymograph analysis for VerCINI microscopy data of vertically immobilized bacteria.
Two analysis methods are provided: 
1) verciniAnalysis.m: Automated kymograph analysis where septa/ cell circumference is localized to sub-pixel precision by fitting an explicit model. The fitted background contribution is subtracted from each image, and a kymograph calculated along the circular line profile of the cell circumference. This should work for most datasets
2) manualVerciniAnalysis.m: Manual analysis where the kymograph is calculated along a circular line profile manually selected for each image stack, based on the maximum intensity projection of the stack. This is mostly used for sparse single molecule datasets if automated VerCINI analysis has failed

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

This package does not require any special hardware. It can be performed on a standard computer.

This package development system has been tested on Windows 10, but should be compatible with other operating systems.

The package requires the following software:
- MATLAB (>=R2018b)
- MATLAB Image processing toolbox
- MATLAB Optimization toolbox

INSTALLATION

Add the 'ring-fitting2' directory to your MATLAB path, and save the updated path so that it will remain installed next time you start MATLAB. Typical install time should be a couple of minutes.

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

To run the software, please see detailed help documentation in the main analysis functions verciniAnalysis.m, manualVerciniAnalysis.m, which can be accessed by typing 'help verciniAnalysis' on the MATLAB command line. Each function should take between 10 s and 10 min to run on a 'standard' computer, depending on the size of the dataset.

DEMO

Test data and example analyses are included in ring-fitting2/testing. Three scripts are provided:
- testCytoplasmicGFP_Analysis.m
- testVerciniAnalysis.m
- testManualVerciniAnalysis.m

Each script can be run either from the command line (i.e. by typing the function name and pressing Enter) or by running them from the Editor. They will automatically analyse example data provided in the ring-fitting2/testing, and produce a new directory ring-fitting2/testing/analysed with the output data. Each should take between 10 s and 1 min to run on a 'standard' computer. Note that for testManualVerciniAnalysis you must manually draw a circle where you see a ring in the image, then press Enter.
